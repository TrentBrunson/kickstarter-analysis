# An Anlysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter data analysis to reveal trends of musicals in Great Britain.

Recommendation: Don't do it!  Musicals in GB = Fail!

### Challenge
---
Analyzed how plays perform compared to goals.  
Plays outperform all other performing arts and media by volume and by at least one order of magnitude (3 in some cases).  If opening a play and seeking Kickstarter funding, springtime is when the uptick begins for the number successful plays, peaking in May and June, then tapering through the summer timeframe.  At the peak (May-June) the number of successful Kickstarter campaigns outnumber the number of failed campaigns by a factor of 2 to 1.  The worst success levels are observed to be winter months with the worst month being December when for every successful play another fails to achieve its funding goal.  Also funding campaigns seeking less than $10,000 most often met their targets.
